Facebook forces users to upload sensitive biometric data and personally identifiable information.

Additionally, it cannot be easily [bridged to other services](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge?tab=readme-ov-file).

i'll be lobbying for migration to another platform as this is a massive breach of privacy and should not be a requirement for industria membership.

Facebook messenger is especially slimy as it tracks users via cookies and [builds shadow profiles](https://techxplore.com/news/2023-09-shadow-profiles.html), which is not preventible.

Another platform with more reasonable requirements should be chosen.

# Criteria of selection of another platform

- Can create an account with nothing but email.
- Can be [bridged](#Bridging) to other platforms

# Bridging
Bridging relays messages between chatrooms in multiple chat services, allowing users to choose their service of choice to follow the chatroom.

bridgeable services:

- [x] msteams
- [x] whatsapp
- [x] discord
- [x] telegram
- [x] zulip
- [ ] facebook messenger

important criteria for selection of a chat platform: allow accounts to be set up solely by email.

I'd argue for a zulip instance to be set up as well as a conventional chat channel, however this is a different debate.
